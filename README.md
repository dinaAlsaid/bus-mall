# bus-mall

A catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel, placed on local busses while commuting through traffic.

The aim is to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interestâ€¦ **before** putting them into the catalog and getting them manufactured.

Features:
* products selected in rounds.
* each round has 3 products listed.
* results are shown in both a list and in a bar chart.
